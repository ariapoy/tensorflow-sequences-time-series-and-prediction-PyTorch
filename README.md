# tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction (PyTorch Ver.)
Sequences, Time Series and Prediction by deeplearning.ai

Course 4 of 4 in the [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice)

## About this Course
If you are a software developer who wants to build scalable AI-powered algorithms, you need to understand how to use the tools to build them. This Specialization will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning.

In this fourth course, you will learn how to build time series models in TensorFlow. You’ll first implement best practices to prepare time series data. You’ll also explore how RNNs and 1D ConvNets can be used for prediction. Finally, you’ll apply everything you’ve learned throughout the Specialization to build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data!

The Machine Learning course and Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng teach the most important and foundational principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This new deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems. To develop a deeper understanding of how neural networks work, we recommend that you take the Deep Learning Specialization.

## About this repository
I use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to implement the code in this course including notebook and exercise.
